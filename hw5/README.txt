Confirming the Birthday Paradox:
When testing the algorithm 1000 times, the resulting data is:
Trial 1:
Twenty three or less: 51.4%
Twenty four or more: 48.6%
Trial 2:
Twenty three or less: 50.5%
Twenty four or more: 49.5%
Trial 3:
Twenty three or less: 51.7%
Twenty four or more: 48.3%
Trial 4:
Twenty three or less: 50.3%
Twenty four or more: 49.7%
Trial 5:
Twenty three or less: 49.9%
Twenty four or more: 50.1%

The ratio is roughly 1:1, with a slight increase in twenty three or less

Probe Rate:
When testing the algorithm 1000 times, with various n values, the resulting data is
Trial 1: n = 100
Actual: 54.74
Trial 2: n = 10
Actual: 5.2
Trial 3: n = 250
Actual: 163.168
Trail 4: n = 500
Actual: 428.412
Trial 5: n = 1000
Actual: 534.184

So the probe rate is approximately n/2 - 7n/10
